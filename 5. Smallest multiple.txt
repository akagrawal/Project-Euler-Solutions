2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

Sol. 
So basically we need to find lowest common multiple of numbers from 1 to 20. For that we need to factorize all the numbers 
and take highest power of each prime number and multiply all of them.
Let's start from 20 and go down one by one.
20 = (2^2)*5
19 = 19
18 = 2*(3^2)
17 = 17
16 = 2^4
15 = 3*5
14 = 2*7
13 = 13
12 = (2^2)*3
11 = 11
10 = 2*5
9 = 3^2
8 = 2^3
7 = 7
6 = 2*3
5 = 5
4 = 2^2
3 = 3
2 = 2

So prime numbers and their highest powers from 1 to 20 are:
N    Power  N^power
2     4      16
3     2      9
5     1      5
7     1      7
11    11     11
13    1      13
17    1      17
19    1      19

Now mutiply all the N^power to get the answer.
So final ans = 16*9*5*7*11*13*17*19 = 232792560.
Notice, ans covers all the numbers from 1 to 20.
